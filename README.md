# J.T.'s NeoVim Configuration

This is my personal configuration for NeoVim.

This repo, like many other projects of mine, is a continual work in progress.

Plugins are registered with Packer in `/lua/packer-setup.lua`. I use the following plugins, and have congured each of them in the `/lua/after` directory:

- codeium
- fugitive
- gitsigns
- lsp-zero
- lualine
- nvm-tree
- telescope
- treesitter
- ufo
- undotree
- vim-maximizer

Occasionally, I push changes to this repository, but it is very likely that my configuration will change over time. Please feel free to use these configurations at your own risk, and if you notice anything that should be changed/if you have any recommendations, feel free to create a pull request or reach out to me.
