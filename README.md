# J.T.'s NeoVim Configuration

This is my personal configuration for NeoVim. I change it on a regular basis and do my best to push my changes to GitHub so that I can always clone them down later if I'm ever working on a different device and want to use NeoVim.

## Plugins

Plugins are registered with Packer in `/lua/packer-setup.lua`.

I use the following plugins, and have configured each of them in the `/lua/after` directory:

- copilot
- fugitive
- gitsigns
- lsp-zero
- lualine
- nvm-tree
- telescope
- treesitter
- ufo
- undotree
- vim-maximizer

## Feedback & Contributions

This repository is a continual work in progress. I regularly push changes to this repository as my workflow changes, so it is very likely that my configuration will change over time. By no means is my config perfect, so use it at your own risk.

If while looking through my repo, you notice any antipatterns or anything else that you think I should consider changing, feel free to reach out or to create a pull request.
