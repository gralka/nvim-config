# J.T.'s NeoVim Configuration

This is my personal configuration for NeoVim.

Plugins are registered with Packer in `/lua/packer-setup.lua`. I use the following plugins, and have configured each of them in the `/lua/after` directory:

- copilot
- fugitive
- gitsigns
- lsp-zero
- lualine
- nvm-tree
- telescope
- treesitter
- ufo
- undotree
- vim-maximizer

Like many other projects of mine, this repository is a continual work in progress. I regularly push changes to this repository as my workflow changes, so it is very likely that my configuration will change over time.

Please feel free to use these configurations at your own risk, and if you notice any antipatterns or anything else that you think I should consider changing, feel free to reach out or to create a pull request.
